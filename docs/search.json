For example you can use the Cascading Style Sheets or CSS to add specific rules to specific elements of your website. By default when you create a quarto website project in RStudio, it will create a file named style.css and add it to your styling options in _quarto.yml. This css file is empty by default. Let’s add some content to modify our headers of level 2 to be green and have more space between letters\n/* css styles */\n\nh2 {\n  color: orange;\n  letter-spacing: 5px;\n}\n\nCreate your own theme with Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets (Sass)\nSass extends existing CSS features in a number of exciting ways, but importantly reduces repetition. You can use .scss stylesheet file(s) to define Sass variables to quickly customize your website’s theme. Sass variables are defined in the form $var-name: value;. Then you can use those variables to assign style to elements (that quarto has predefined). For example, let’s make our navigation bar purple:\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n\n// colors\n$purple: #800080;        /* define the variable purple as a color */\n$navbar-bg: $purple;     /* use this variable to change navbar background */\n\n// import Google font-size\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@400;700&family=Nunito:wght@300;800&family=Roboto+Mono:wght@300;400&family=Sanchez&display=swap');\n\n// fonts\n$font-family-sans-serif: 'Nunito', sans-serif;\n$font-family-serif: 'Sanchez', serif;\n$font-family-monospace: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;\nAnd modify the _quarto.yml as follow:\n...\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme:\n      - cosmo  #flatly\n      - mytheme.scss\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true"
