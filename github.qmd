title: "Hosting on GitHub Pages"
---

You can use GitHub pages to host your website for free! Every time you push new content, your website will update within 
a few minutes!! There are different workflows available for this setup. In this workshop, we are opting to save the rendered 
html files to a `docs` folder on the main branch of our repository, which is a naming convention that GitHub uses to point
to content for GitHub pages.


| Approach  | Pro  | Con  |
|----------|--------| --------|
| folder   | Easy to setup   | You need to make sure to first render and commit changes locally |
| folder   | Better control when to render the website | More "busy" commits |
| branch   | Automatic rendering on push  | Setup requires to know (some) GitHub Actions syntax |
| branch   | better separation of Quarto and html files  | Rendering can be slow |

## Using the `docs` folder  

1. **Setup the `docs` subfolder**:  
In your project folder on your machine, create a docs subfolder. Then edit the `_quarto.yml` to specify we want to render
content into this `docs` folder by setting up the ` output-dir` parameter

```yaml
    project:
      type: website
      output-dir: docs
    
    website:
      title: "Publishing Quarto websites with GitHub pages"
      navbar:
       ...
```
2. **Disable GitHub Pages automatic rendering**:
Add a `.nojekyll` empty file at the root/top level of your repository. You can use any text editor (including RStudio or VS code) or the command line: `touch .nojekyll`

3. **Render your website locally**:   
Use either your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or running `quarto::quarto_render()` at the R console. 

4. Upload your website to GitHub:  
Commit and Push the `docs` folder to your remote repository on GitHub

5. **Setup GitHub Pages**:   
On the GitHub website, navigate to your repository page and click on `Settings` tab and choose `Pages` on the left panel
and select the `./docs/` folder and save:
![](img/gh-pages_docs.png){width=80% fig-align="center"}

6.**Add your website URL** to your repo:  
Go back to the main page of your repository and in the right panel, click on the wheel for settings. Add the link of your
website to your repository by checking the box `Use your GitHub Pages website`:

![](img/gh-add_url.png){width=70% fig-align="center"}


## Using the `gh-pages` branch  

You can also make GitHub render your Quarto website! It is a more automated workflow, however, it will require you to dig
into GitHub Actions scripting. To do so, you will have to create a special branch named `gh-pages` 
and write a GitHub Action. Here is the one we used for this website:

1. **Create a `gh-pages` branch**  

2. **Setup the branch** to host your website:
On your repository homepage, click the `Settings` tab and choose `Pages` on the left panel and select `gh-pages` branch and
the `/(root)/` folder and save:
![](img/gh-pages_branch.png){width=70% fig-align="center"}

3. **Add a new GitHub Action workflow**: 
Go back to the main page of your repository and click the `Actions` tab and hit the "New workflow" button.
![](img/gh-action_add.png){width=70% fig-align="center"}

   On the next page with several predefined workflows, click on `Skip this and set up a workflow yourself →`

4. **Add the GitHub Action code**:  

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: main

name: Quarto Publish

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2

      - name: Install R
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
        with:
          r-version: '4.5.1'
          
      - name: Install R Dependencies
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2
        with:
          packages:
            any::knitr
            any::rmarkdown
            any::lterdatasampler
            any::tidyverse
            any::plotly
            any::sf
            any::leaflet

      - name: Render and Publish
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: gh-pages
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```


***Now every time you push to GitHub, your website will render automatically!!***
